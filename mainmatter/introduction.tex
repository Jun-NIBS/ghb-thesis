\chapter{Introduction}
\labelChapter{introduction}

\enlargethispage{3pt}

Processors are built to execute a vast range of \glspl{program}, from tiny
\emph{Hello, world!} samples to large-scale Earth simulations.
%
Most importantly, the processors are built to minimize the execution time for
these \glspl{program}.
%
To this end, CPU manufacturers continuously extend their processors with new,
sophisticated \glspl{instruction} that allow complex computations to be executed
using fewer \glspl{instruction}.
%
Such \glspl{instruction} are especially common in \glspl{DSP} that appear in
most contemporary mobile phones.
%
But while the technology behind modern processors continues to advance, the
techniques for automatically making use of the \glspl{instruction} have not.
%
In fact, the state-of-the-art \glspl{compiler} -- these are tools for
translating \glspl{program} into \gls{assembly code} -- essentially apply the
same techniques for selecting \glspl{instruction} that were used in the 1980s.


\paragraph{Problem Statement}

Due to underlying assumptions, many of the \glspl{instruction} currently
available in modern processors cannot be handled by these techniques.
%
In particular, they rely on representations that are too limited for modeling
these \glspl{instruction}.
%
Instead, \gls{compiler} developers are forced to implement hand-written routines
for checking whether a specific \gls{instruction} is applicable and, if so,
greedily selecting it.
%
With over \num{100}~million microprocessors being shipped every
quarter~\cite{Intel:2014:NewsRelease}, through release cycles that become
shorter and shorter, there is a growing need for new and improved
\gls{instruction selection} techniques.

Furthermore, the set of selectable \glspl{instruction} is highly dependent on
other \gls{compiler} tasks.
%
One such task is \gls{global code motion}, which involves moving computations
from one part of the \gls{program} to another.
%
Integrating \gls{global code motion} with \gls{instruction selection} enables a
larger set of combinations of computations, some of which may be implemented
using sophisticated \glspl{instruction}.
%
Another task is \gls{block ordering}, which involves arranging the \gls{program}
\glspl{block} into a consecutive sequence.
%
Depending on the processor, one set of selected \glspl{instruction} may impact
the possible \gls{block} sequence and vice versa.
%
Consequently, in order to generate high-quality code, these tasks must be
performed in unison.


\paragraph{Universal Instruction Selection}

This dissertation introduces \gls!{universal instruction selection}, a new
approach based on \glsdesc{CP} that addresses the problems recently described.

\begin{figure}
  \centering%
  \input{figures/introduction/approach-overview}

  \caption{Overview of the approach}
  \labelFigure{approach-overview}
\end{figure}

Outlined in \refFigure{approach-overview}, the approach is the first to combine
\gls{instruction selection} with \gls{global code motion} and \gls{block
  ordering}.
%
In doing so, our approach alleviates selection of sophisticated
\glspl{instruction} that would otherwise not have been selectable.
%
The approach relies on a novel combinatorial model that is simpler and more
flexible compared to the techniques currently used by modern \glspl{compiler}.
%
It also captures crucial features that are ignored by other, existing
combinatorial approaches.
%
We also propose extensions for integrating \gls{instruction scheduling} and
\gls{register allocation}, which are two other \gls{code generation} tasks known
to impact \gls{instruction selection}.

The model is enabled by a novel, \gls{graph}-based representation that unifies
data flow and control flow for entire \glspl{function}.
%
Not only is this representation crucial for combining \gls{instruction
  selection} with \gls{global code motion}, it also enables \glspl{instruction}
whose behavior contains both data and control flow to be modeled as
\glspl{graph}.
%
Hence there is no longer any need for hand-written routines to handle
\glspl{instruction} that violate underlying assumptions about the
\gls{instruction set}.


\section{Thesis Statement}
\labelSection{intro-thesis-statement}

\begin{statement}
  \Glsdesc{CP} is a flexible, practical, competitive, and
  extensible approach for combining \gls{global.is} \gls{instruction selection},
  \gls{global code motion}, and \gls{block ordering}.
\end{statement}
%
By \emph{flexible}, it means that our approach can handle hardware architectures
with a rich \gls{instruction set}.
%
By \emph{practical}, it means that our approach can select \glspl{instruction}
for \glspl{program} of sufficient complexity and scales to medium-sized
\glspl{function} (measured in hundreds of \glspl{operation}).
%
By \emph{competitive}, it means that our approach generates code of equal or
better quality compared to the state of the art.
%
By \emph{extensible}, it means that our approach can be extended to integrate
other \gls{code generation} tasks.


\section{Motivation}
\labelSection{intro-motivation}

A \gls!{compiler} is a tool that takes a \gls{program}, written in some
programming language, as input and produces equivalent \gls{assembly code} for a
specific processor, called the \gls!{target machine}, as output.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering%
  \input{figures/introduction/compiler-overview}

  \caption{Overview of a typical compiler}
  \labelFigure{compiler-overview}
\end{figure}
%
As shown in \refFigure{compiler-overview}, a \gls{compiler} typically consists
of three parts:%
%
\begin{inlinelist}[itemjoin={; }, itemjoin*={; and}]
  \item a \gls!{frontend}, which performs syntactic and semantic analysis and
    transforms the program into an \gls!{IR}
  \item an \gls!{optimizer} (sometimes called \gls!{middle-end}), which performs
    target-independent optimizations
  \item a \gls!{backend}, which performs \gls{code generation}
\end{inlinelist}.

The \gls{optimizer} is arguably the largest component of any \gls{compiler},
consisting of many tasks such as \gls{constant folding}, \gls{dead code
  elimination}, and \gls{loop unrolling}.
%
Another such optimization is \gls!{global code motion}, where \glspl{operation}
are moved from one \gls{basic block} to another, which is done mainly to move
expensive \glspl{operation} into \glspl{block} with lower execution frequency.

The \gls{backend} also consists of several tasks, of which three
typically are most promiment:%
%
\begin{inlinelist}[itemjoin={; }, itemjoin*={; and}]
  \item \gls!{instruction selection}, where \glspl{instruction} implementing the
    given \gls{program} are selected
  \item \gls!{register allocation}, where \gls{virtual.temp} \glspl{temporary}
    are assigned to \glspl{register}
  \item \gls!{instruction scheduling}, where \glspl{instruction} are reordered
    to increase instruction-level parallelism
\end{inlinelist}.
%
Another code generation task of interest is \gls!{block ordering}, where the
\glspl{basic block} are rearranged in order to minimize the number of jump
\glspl{instruction}.

            The program computes the saturated sums of two arrays \irVar{A} and
            \irVar{B} as a new array~\irVar{C}, all of which are assumed to be
            of equal lengths and stored in memory.
            %
            The variables \irVar{N} and \irVar{MAX} are constants representing
            the array length and the upper limit, respectively.
            %
            An integer is assumed to be 4~bytes%
          }
  \labelFigure{isel-gcmotion-example}%
\end{figure}

\labelPage{saturated-arithmetic}

\RefFigure{isel-gcmotion-example} shows a program that computes the saturated
sums of two integer arrays.
%
In \gls!{saturation arithmetic}, the result of an arithmetic \gls{operation}
will always stay within a range fixed by a minimum and maximum value.
%
If the \gls{operation} would produce a value outside of this range, then the
value is set (``clamped'') to the closest limit, thus becoming ``saturated''.

Assume a \gls{target machine} that has an instruction capable of implementing
the saturated-add \gls{operation} used in the \gls{program} shown in
\refFigure{isel-gcmotion-example}.
%
Hence the \gls{instruction} would implement the following five operations:%
%
\begin{inlinelist}[itemjoin={, }, itemjoin*={, and}]
  \item the \irAdd{\irVar{a}}{\irVar{b}} addition
  \item the \irLE{\irVar{MAX}}{\irVar{c}} comparison
  \item the conditional jump to either of blocks~\irBlock{b4} and~\irBlock{b5}
  \item the \irAssign{\irVar{c}}{\irVar{MAX}} assignment
  \item the unconditional jump to~\irBlock{b5}
\end{inlinelist}.
%
Selecting this \gls{instruction} can have tremendous impact on performance.
%
Assume, for example, that each \gls{operation} can be implemented using an
\gls{instruction} that takes one cycle to execute. Hence executing one iteration
of the loop takes \num{16}~cycles, and selecting the saturated-add
\gls{instruction} reduces the execution time by \SI{25}{\percent}.

Existing \gls{instruction selection} techniques and representations, however, do
not support selection of such \glspl{instruction}.
%
Since the \glspl{operation} above reside in separate \glspl{block} (\irBlock{b3}
and \irBlock{b4}), making use of the saturated-add \gls{instruction} requries an
\gls{instruction selector} that is capable of processing multiple \glspl{basic
  block} simultaneously.
%
In comparison, traditional \gls{instruction selection} techniques only consider
one \gls{basic block} at a time.
%
Morever, most approaches represent the \glspl{instruction} as \glspl{graph}.
%
As the saturated-add \gls{instruction} contains \glspl{operation} for both data
and control flow, modeling it as a \gls{graph} requires a representation that
captures both data and control flow.
%
In comparison, existing representations only capture data flow.


\subsection{For Combining Instruction Selection and Global Code Motion}

Assume that the \gls{target machine} also has a \gls{SIMD.instr}
\gls{instruction} for addition.\!%
%
\footnote{%
  A \gls!{SIMD.instr}[ \gls{instruction}] is an \gls{instruction} that executes
  the same \gls{operation} over multiple sets of input data.%
}
%
Revisiting the example shown in \refFigure{isel-gcmotion-example}, there are
four additions in the \gls{program} (\irAdd{\irVar{A}}{\irTemp{2}},
\irAdd{\irVar{B}}{\irTemp{2}}, \irAdd{\irVar{C}}{\irTemp{2}}, and
\irAdd{\irVar{i}}{\irVar{1}}) which are independent from one another and can
therefore be executed in parallel.
%
Assuming again that all \glspl{instruction} takes one cycle to execute,
implementing these four additions using a single \gls{SIMD.instr}
\gls{instruction} would improve performance by almost \SI{19}{\percent}.
%
This requires that the two additions in block~\irBlock{b5} be moved to
block~\irBlock{b4}, which is the task of \gls{global code motion}.
%
However, as \gls{global code motion} is commonly considered to be a
target-independent optimization, it is often done before \gls{code generation}.
%
Consequently, the \gls{global code mover} may take decisions which are
detrimental for the \gls{instruction selector}.


\subsection{For Taking Cost of Data Copying Into Account}

Although selecting \gls{SIMD.instr} \glspl{instruction} may significantly
improve code quality -- like in the previous example -- doing so carelessly may
also have the opposite effect.
%
Assume, for example, that the \gls{SIMD.instr} \gls{instruction} uses a limited
set of registers.
%
If the other selected \glspl{instruction} cannot directly write to and read from
these registers, then additional \glspl{instruction} must be emitted to copy the
values between the general registers and the \gls{SIMD.instr} registers.
%
In the case of the program shown in \refFigure{isel-gcmotion-example}, eight
such \glspl{instruction} would be needed, leading to a slowdown of over
\SI{31}{\percent}.
%
These restrictions must be known by the \gls{instruction selector} to make
effective use of \gls{SIMD.instr} \glspl{instruction}.

          }
  \labelFigure{isel-blorder-example}%
\end{figure}

\RefFigure{isel-blorder-example} shows a \gls{function} that keeps calling
another \gls{function} (with side effects) until it returns a non-zero value.
%
Assume that the \gls{target machine} has three \glspl{instruction} for handling
control flow:%
%
\begin{inlinelist}[itemjoin={; }, itemjoin*={; and}]
  \item a \mbox{{\instrFont jmp} $p$, $b$} \gls{instruction}, which
    branches to block~$b$ if the value in register~$p$ corresponds the Boolean
    value~$\mathit{true}$
  \item a \mbox{{\instrFont jmp} $r \neq 0$, $b$} \gls{instruction}, which
    branches to block~$b$ if the condition \mbox{$r \neq 0$} holds, where $r$
    is a register
  \item a \mbox{{\instrFont jmp} $b$} \gls{instruction}, which
    unconditionally branches to block~$b$
\end{inlinelist}.
%
Assume also that these branch \glspl{instruction} take three cycles compared to
the other \glspl{instruction} in the \gls{target machine}, which take one cycle.

At first glance it appears that only the first jump \gls{instruction} is
selectable for implementing the conditional branch (see
\refFigure{isel-blorder-example-code-1}), leading to a total of six cycles for
the entire \gls{function}.
%
But by flipping the condition and swapping block labels (conditionally jumping
to \irBlock{b2} instead of \irBlock{b1}), the more complex jump
\gls{instruction} becomes selectable (see
\refFigure{isel-blorder-example-code-2}), bringing the cycle count to five
cycles and thus reducing the execution time by almost \SI{17}{\percent}.
%
However, although this decision may appear better at the point of
\gls{instruction selection}, it necessitates an additional jump
\gls{instruction} when ordering the \glspl{block} (because block~\irBlock{b1}
cannot fall-through to the top of itself; see
\refFigure{isel-blorder-example-code-3}).
%
This code takes eight cycles to execute, thus leading to a slowdown of
\SI{33}{\percent}.
%
The \gls{instruction selector} must therefore be aware of additional jump
\glspl{instruction} that may be required when making such decisions.


\section{Contributions}

        another -- and solving these two problems in unison.
    \end{contributions}
  \item \labelContribution{constraint-model}
    It introduces a \gls{constraint model} and related transformations for
    \gls{universal instruction selection} which, for the first time, enables

\refPublication{survey-report} is excluded as it is subsumed and extended by
\refPublication{survey-book}. \refPublication{scopes}--\refPublication{cc} are
excluded as they are only partially related to the dissertation (they apply
\glsdesc{CP} to solve \gls{register allocation} and \gls{instruction scheduling}
without considering \gls{instruction selection}). \refPublication{fdl-2016} is
excluded as it belongs to a different topic entirely (high-level code generation

\section{Research Methodology}
\labelSection{intro-research-methodology}

We begin with a thorough and systematic literature review to identify the
strengths and limitations of existing \gls{instruction selection} techniques and
common denominators among them.
%
As part of this study, four \gls{instruction selection} \glspl{principle} and
five \glspl{instruction characteristic} are identified and the techniques are
systematically classified accordingly.
%
This classification enables us to recognize that certain classes of
\glspl{instruction} are poorly supported by existing \gls{instruction selection}
techniques.
%
In particular this is due to lack of appropriate \gls{program} and
\gls{instruction} representations.

Having established the need for new representations, we identify a set of
requirements that such a representation must fulfill.
%
We then build a new representation by unifying two existing, well-established
representations -- one for capturing data flow and another for capturing control
flow -- and then augment the result as needed until all requirements are met.
%
As is common, we then apply a traditional \gls{subgraph isomorphism} algorithm
for doing \gls{pattern matching} on this new representation.

With the new representation at hand, we proceed with building the
\gls{constraint model}.
%
For each task to be integrated, we first identify what constitutes a
\gls{solution} to this task and then add the necessary \glspl{variable} and
\glspl{constraint} to enforce such \glspl{solution}.
%
If more than one design choice exists for integrating the task, then we
implement both as separate \glsplshort{constraint model} and evaluate which is
better before proceeding.
%
This is because the tasks are orthogonal from one another and can therefore be
evaluated in isolation.
%
The evaluation methodology is described in
\refSection{intro-evaluation-methodology}.

Once all tasks are integrated, we apply a range of solving techniques in order
to increase scalability and robustness.
%
Because these techniques influence one another, we first evaluate the usefulness
of each solving technique individually in order to form groups of solving
techniques and then evaluate each group as a whole.
%
This is to avoid unreasonably long experiment runtimes.

Using the \gls{constraint model} with the best design choices and solving
techniques, we then evaluate the significance of our approach by comparing its
\glspl{solution} with those produced by the state of the art.


\section{Evaluation Methodology}
\labelSection{intro-evaluation-methodology}

\subsection{Experiment Setup}

To evaluate a \gls{constraint model}, we implement it using \mbox{\gls{MiniZinc}
  2.1.6}~\cite{NethercoteEtAl:2007} -- a high-level \gls{constraint} modeling
language -- and then solve it using \gls{Chuffed}~\cite{Chu:2011} -- a \gls{lazy
  clause learning} \glsshort{constraint solver}, which is included in
\gls{MiniZinc} -- on a Linux machine with an \gls{Intel} Xeon W3530 at
\SI{2.80}{\GHz} and \SI{16}{\giga\byte} main memory.
%
To mitigate deviations in the measurments, we run each experiment ten times and
then take the arithmetic average together with the \gls{CV}.
%
When summarizing ratios, we instead take the geometric mean since this is more
appropriate in such cases~\cite{FlemingWallace:1986}.

As problem instances, we use the \glspl{function} provided by
\gls{MediaBench}~\cite{LeeEtAl:1997} -- a benchmark suite for embedded systems
-- and the \glspl{instruction} in \gls{Hexagon}~V5 -- a \gls{DSP} with a rich
\gls{instruction set}.
%
The \gls{MediaBench} suite consists of \num{6313}~\glspl{function}, which are
compiled into \gls{LLVM} \gls{IR} code -- the intermediate format used by
\gls{LLVM} -- using \mbox{\gls{LLVM} 3.8} with optimization flag~\texttt{-O3}.
%
Due to insuffiicent support in our current toolchain, we remove all
\glspl{function} that operate on non-integer data types (such as floating point
and vector data types).
%
This leaves \num{3094}~\glspl{function}, on which further filtering will be
performed as needed for the given experiment.

For all experiments in this dissertation, the remaining pool of \glspl{function}
is too large for all to be included in the experiment as that would lead to
intractable experiment runtimes.
%
We therefore draw a limited number of samples from this pool.
%
To get a diverse set of samples, we apply \gls{k-means
  clustering}~\cite{PhansalkarEtAl:2005} to divide the \glspl{function} into
twenty clusters based on three features.
%
The first feature is the application from which the \gls{function} is derived
since, intuitively, \glspl{function} from different applications should exhibit
different characteristics.
%
The second feature is the size in number of \gls{LLVM} \gls{IR}
\glspl{instruction}.
%
This is to evaluate how the \gls{constraint model} behave as the
\glspl{function} grow larger.
%
The third feature is the number of memory \glspl{instruction}.
%
This is because, due to its many addressing modes, the memory
\glspl{instruction} constitute a large part of the more sophisticated
\glspl{instruction} in the \gls{instruction set}).
%
Based on these features, from each cluster we then randomly select one
\gls{function}, giving a total of twenty \glspl{function}.


\subsection{Normalizing Measurements}

\newcommand{\speedupCase}[1]{\textrm{\textsc{#1}}}

When we are interested in the relative difference between the measurements, we
normalize all values to those obtained from one \glsshort{constraint model}
which has been chosen as the \gls!{baseline}.
%
In this context, the other \glsplshort{constraint model} are called the
\glspl!{subject}.

For time measurements, the most typical method for normalization is to calculate
the \gls!{speedup}, which is computed as
%
\begin{equation}
  S = \frac{t_b}{t_a}
  \labelEquation{speedup-normalization}
\end{equation}
%
where $t_a$ and $t_b$ denotes time measurements obtained for a given problem
instance from \gls{subject} \glsshort{constraint model}~$a$ and \gls{baseline}
\glsshort{constraint model}~$b$.
%
A value greater than $1$ means $a$ is faster than $b$, a value less than $1$
means $b$ is faster than $a$, and a value of exactly $1$ means $a$ and $b$ take
the same time to solve a given \gls{function}.

This method, however, creates problems when plotting the normalized values as
barcharts.
%
Since the normalized values are centered around $1$, when $a$ is twice as fast
as $b$ we intuitively expect the normalized value to be equally far away from
$1$ as when $b$ is twice as fast as $a$.
%
With \refEquation{speedup-normalization}, this is not the case.
%
See for example \refFigure{speedup-comparison-regular}, illustrating two
cases: \speedupCase{i}, where $a$ is twice as fast as $b$; and \speedupCase{ii},
where $b$ is twice as fast as $a$.

  \caption[Comparison between two methods for normalizing measurements]%
          {%
            Comparison between the two methods for normalizing measurements.
            %
            The comparison is done for two problem instances: one where the
            subject is twice as fast as the baseline (\speedupCase{i}), and
            another where the baseline is twice as fast as the subject
            (\speedupCase{ii})%
          }%
  \labelFigure{speedup-comparison}%
\end{figure}
%
We therefore normalize the values using a different method~[\todo{source?}]
when plotting such values.
%
In this dissertation the method is called \gls!{zero-centered normalization},
which is computed as
%
\begin{equation}
  S =
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{t_b - t_a}{t_a} & \text{if $t_b \geq t_a$,} \\
    \frac{t_b - t_a}{t_b} & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \labelEquation{zero-centered-normalization}
\end{equation}
%
As seen in \refFigure{speedup-comparison-zero-centered}, this method results in
normalized values that are centered around $0$ (hence its name) and, unlike the
\gls{speedup} method, are equally far apart in the case of \speedupCase{i} and
\speedupCase{ii}.
%
A normalized value $v$ using \gls{zero-centered normalization} corresponds a
\gls{speedup} of \mbox{$v + 1$} if \mbox{$v \geq 0$}, otherwise
\mbox{$\frac{1}{1 - v}$}.

\Gls{zero-centered normalization} is also applied when comparing \gls{solution}
costs as they represent an estimate of the time it would take to execute the
code yielded by the \glspl{solution} (our current implementation is not yet able
to hook back into \gls{LLVM} in order to generate executable code).

When summarizing normalized values, however, we do not use \gls{zero-centered
  normalization} as the geometric mean cannot be computed for such values.
%
In such cases, we instead use the values normalized using the \gls{speedup}
method as the geometric mean can be computed for such values, which we call the
\gls!{GMI}.
%
A result is considered positive or negative if the \gls{GMI} is greater than
respectively less than~\num{1}.
%
In terms of solving time, for example, a \gls{subject} method~$a$ leads to an
overall reduction over another \gls{baseline} method~$b$ if the \gls{GMI} is
greater than~\num{1}.


\subsection{Attaining Statistically Significant Results}

Because we can only run experiments on a small set of \glspl{function} sampled
from much larger pool, the \gls{GMI} we attain from the sampled set may not be
representative for the pool as a whole.
%
In other words, the result may not be statistically significant.
%
Therefore, for the \gls{GMI} value we also compute the \gls!{CI}, which is a
method of estimating the uncertainty of a value computed from a set of
samples~\cite{Neyman:1937}.
%
Every \gls{CI} is computed with a predefined degree of confidence, typically
written as the $X$\textsuperscript{th} \gls{CI}.
%
This means that if the $X$\textsuperscript{th} \gls{CI} of the \gls{GMI} value
is greater than or less than~\num{1}, then we can statistically conclude with
$X\%$ confidence that the result is positive respectively negative.
%
If the \gls{CI} contains~\num{1}, then the result is inconclusive.

For the experiments described in this dissertation, we compute the
\num{95}\textsuperscript{th} \gls{CI} as is common for most statistical
experiments.
%
Since we know nothing about the underlying distributions for our observations,
we compute the \gls{CI} using \gls{percentile bootstrapping} with
\num{100000}~iterations~\cite{EfronTibshirani:1994}.
