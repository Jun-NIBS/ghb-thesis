\section{TODO}

\Gls{instruction selection} can be reduced into two subproblems:%
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finding all instances of instructions that can implement one or more
    \glspl{operation} in the \gls{program}.
  \item Selecting a subset of these instances such that all \glspl{operation}
    are implemented.
\end{enumerate}
%
Without loss of generality, assume that the input to the \gls{instruction
  selector} to consist of a single \gls{function}, which in turn consists of
many \glspl{basic block} (henceforth referred to as simply \glspl!{block}).

Most \glspl{compiler} solve the two problems above using graph-based methods.
%
First, the \gls{IR} code is transformed into a \gls!{data-flow graph}, where
nodes represent \glspl{operation} in the function and edges represent data
dependencies between the \glspl{operation}.
%
\Glspl{data-flow graph} limited to \glspl{block} are called \glspl!{block
  graph}, and \glspl{data-flow graph} capturing data flow of whole functions are
called \glspl!{function graph}.
%
Corresponding \glspl{data-flow graph}, called \glspl!{pattern graph} (or simply
\glspl!{pattern}), are also built to represent the \gls{instruction} provided by
the \gls{target machine}.
%
The set of \glspl{pattern graph} for a particular \gls{target machine}
constitute a \gls!{pattern set}.

            An example demonstrating the pattern matching and selection
            problem for a program that loads a value from integer array
            \irVar{A} at offset \irVar{i} $+$ \irVar{1} (it is assumed that
            \irVar{A} is stored in memory and that an integer is 4~bytes).
            Valid covers are \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_2, m_3, m_5}$},
            \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_4, m_5}$}, and \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_6}$}%
          }
  \labelFigure{p-match-sel-example}

The first subproblem can be reduced to finding all instances where a
\gls{pattern} from the \gls{pattern set} is subgraph isomorphic to~$G$, where
$G$ denotes either a \gls{block graph} or a \gls{function graph}.
%
Each such instance is called a \gls!{match}, and the set of all \glspl{match}
constitute a \gls!{match set}, which is denoted by~$M$.
%
Hence this subproblem is referred to as the \gls!{pattern matching}[ problem].
%
\Gls{pattern matching} can be done in linear time if both $G$ and all
\glspl{pattern} are tree-shaped, otherwise it is an NP-complete
problem~\cite{GareyJohnson:1979,HoffmannODonnell:1982}.
%
Having found $M$, the second subproblem -- which is referred to as the
\gls!{pattern selection}[ problem] -- can be reduced to selecting a set of
\glspl{match} that \gls{cover}[s]~$G$.
%
A subset~\mbox{$C \subseteq M$}, where $M$ is a \gls{match set},
\gls!{cover}[s] $G$ if every \gls{operation} in $G$ appears in exactly one match
from~$C$.
%
Such a subset is called a \gls!{cover}.
%
See \refFigure{p-match-sel-example} for an example.

For a given \gls{program} and \gls{target machine}, there often exists many
valid combinations of \glspl{instruction} -- in terms of $G$ and $M$, this means
there exist many \glspl{cover} of~$G$ -- which may result in code where quality
differs significantly.
%
In certain cases, the performance of two sets of selected instructions may
differ by as much as two orders of magnitude~\cite{ZivojnovicEtAl:1994}.
%
Consequently, the \gls{pattern selection} problem -- originally defined to
accept any valid \gls{cover} -- is augmented into an optimization problem called
\gls!{optimal.ps} \gls{pattern selection}, where only \glspl{cover} with least
cost are accepted.
%
The cost of a \gls{cover}~$C$ is the sum of the costs for the \glspl{match}
appearing in~$C$, where the cost of a \gls{match} has been assigned to reflect a
desired characteristic in the produced code.
%
For example, assume that the \instrCode{add}, \instrCode{mul}, and
\instrCode{mad} \glspl{instruction} in \refFigure{p-match-sel-example} take one
cycle to execute whereas the \instrCode{load} \glspl{instruction} take five
cycles to execute.
%
Assume further that the \gls{compiler} should maximize performance.
%
The corresponding matches \mbox{$m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, m_6$} are therefore
assigned costs \mbox{$1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5$}, respectively.
%
Then, of the valid \glspl{cover} \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_2, m_3, m_5}$},
\mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_4, m_5}$}, and \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_6}$}, only the last
\gls{cover} is considered \gls{optimal.ps} as it has a total cost of~6 whereas
the other two \glspl{cover} have costs~8 and~7, respectively.
%
There is typically a strong correlation between the size of a \gls{cover} and
its cost -- smaller \glspl{cover} lead to less cost, and ultimately better code
-- but this depends heavily on the properties of the \gls{target machine}.



\section{Traditional Approaches}

In the interest of producing decent code while maintaining short compilation
times, most modern \glspl{compiler} either limit themselves to \glspl{block
  graph} or apply greedy, linear-time heuristics.
%
For \glspl{block graph} one can find \gls{least-cost.cover} \glspl{cover} in
linear time, but at the price of precluding optimization decisions that only
become possible when operating on \glspl{function graph}.

The most common and well known technique that operate on \glspl{block graph} was
introduced by \textcite{AhoEtAl:1989}.

The technique is based on dynamic programming and ...
