\chapter{Existing Instruction Selection Techniques and Representations}
\labelChapter{existing-isel-techniques-and-reps}

This chapter introduces terminology and relevant background.
%
\refSection{refining-instruction-selection-into-a-graph-problem} refines
\gls{instruction selection} into a graph problem and provides many definitions
that will be used throughout the dissertation.
%
\refSection{traditional-approaches} discusses existing traditional approaches to
\gls{instruction selection}, and \refSection{combinatorial-approaches} discusses
the combinatorial counterparts.
%
A more extensive discussion is given in
\refAppendixRange{macro-expansion}{graph-covering}.



\section{Refining Instruction Selection into a Graph Problem}
\labelSection{refining-instruction-selection-into-a-graph-problem}

\Gls{instruction selection} can be reduced into two subproblems:%
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finding all instances of instructions that can implement one or more
    \glspl{operation} in the \gls{program}.
  \item Selecting a subset of these instances such that all \glspl{operation}
    are implemented.
\end{enumerate}
%
Without loss of generality, assume that the input to the \gls{instruction
  selector} to consist of a single \gls{function}, which in turn consists of
many \glspl{basic block} (henceforth referred to as simply \glspl!{block}).

Most \glspl{compiler} solve the two problems above using \gls{graph}-based
methods.
%
First, the \gls{IR} code is transformed into a \gls!{data-flow graph}, where
\glspl{node} represent \glspl{operation} in the function and \glspl{edge}
represent data dependencies between the \glspl{operation}.
%
\Glspl{data-flow graph} are called \glspl!{expression tree} if they are limited
to single, tree-shaped expressions, \glspl!{block DAG} if they capture many
expressions in a \gls{block} as a \gls{DAG}, and \glspl{data-flow graph} if they
capture the data flow of entire functions.
%
An \gls{instruction selector} is \gls!{local.is} if it selects
\glspl{instruction} for \glspl{expression tree} or \glspl{block DAG}, and
\gls!{global.is} if it does so for \glspl{function graph}.
%
Corresponding \glspl{data-flow graph}, called \glspl!{pattern graph} (or simply
\glspl!{pattern}), are also built to represent the \gls{instruction} provided by
the \gls{target machine}.
%
The set of \glspl{pattern graph} for a particular \gls{target machine}
constitute a \gls!{pattern set}.

The first subproblem can be reduced to finding all instances where a
\gls{pattern} from the \gls{pattern set} is \gls{subgraph} isomorphic to~$G$,
where $G$ denotes either a \gls{block DAG} or a \gls{function graph}.
%
Each such instance is called a \gls!{match}, and the set of all \glspl{match}
constitute a \gls!{match set}, which is denoted by~$M$.
%
Hence this subproblem is referred to as the \gls!{pattern matching}[ problem].
%
\Gls{pattern matching} can be done in linear time if both $G$ and all
\glspl{pattern} are tree-shaped, otherwise it is an NP-complete
problem~\cite{GareyJohnson:1979,HoffmannODonnell:1982}.
%
Having found $M$, the second subproblem -- which is referred to as the
\gls!{pattern selection}[ problem] -- can be reduced to selecting a set of
\glspl{match} that \gls{cover}[s]~$G$.
%
A subset~\mbox{$C \subseteq M$}, where $M$ is a \gls{match set},
\gls!{cover}[s] $G$ if every \gls{operation} in $G$ appears in exactly one match
from~$C$.
%
Such a subset is called a \gls!{cover}, and an example is shown in
\refFigure{p-match-sel-example}.

            problem for a program that loads a value from integer array
            \irVar{A} at offset \irVar{i} $+$ \irVar{1} (it is assumed that
            \irVar{A} is stored in memory and that an integer is 4~bytes).
            Valid covers are \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_2, m_3, m_5}$},
            \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_4, m_5}$}, and \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_6}$}%
          }
  \labelFigure{p-match-sel-example}
\end{figure}

For a given \gls{program} and \gls{target machine}, there often exists many
valid combinations of \glspl{instruction} -- in terms of $G$ and $M$, this means
there exist many \glspl{cover} of~$G$ -- which may result in code where quality
differs significantly.
%
In certain cases, the performance of two sets of selected instructions may
differ by as much as two orders of magnitude~\cite{ZivojnovicEtAl:1994}.
%
Consequently, the \gls{pattern selection} problem -- originally defined to
accept any valid \gls{cover} -- is augmented into an optimization problem called
\gls!{optimal.ps} \gls{pattern selection}, where only \glspl{cover} with least
cost are accepted.
%
The cost of a \gls{cover}~$C$ is the sum of the costs for the \glspl{match}
appearing in~$C$, where the cost of a \gls{match} has been assigned to reflect a
desired characteristic in the produced code.
%
For example, assume that the \instrCode{add}, \instrCode{mul}, and
\instrCode{muladd} \glspl{instruction} in \refFigure{p-match-sel-example} take
one cycle to execute whereas the \instrCode{load} and \instrCode{amload}
\glspl{instruction} take five cycles to execute.
%
Assume further that the \gls{compiler} should maximize performance.
%
The corresponding matches \mbox{$m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, m_6$} are therefore
assigned costs \mbox{$1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5$}, respectively.
%
Then, of the valid \glspl{cover} \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_2, m_3, m_5}$},
\mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_4, m_5}$}, and \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_6}$}, only the last
\gls{cover} is considered \gls{optimal.ps} as it has a total cost of~6 whereas
the other two \glspl{cover} have costs~8 and~7, respectively.
%
There is typically a strong correlation between the size of a \gls{cover} and
its cost -- smaller \glspl{cover} lead to less cost, and ultimately better code
-- but this depends heavily on the properties of the \gls{target machine}.



\section{Traditional Approaches}
\labelSection{traditional-approaches}

In the interest of producing decent code while maintaining short compilation
times, most modern \glspl{compiler} either limit themselves to \glspl{expression
  tree} or apply greedy, linear-time heuristics.
%
For \glspl{expression tree} one can find \gls{least-cost.c} \glspl{cover} in
linear time, but at the price of precluding optimization decisions that only
become possible when operating on \glsshort{block DAG} or \glspl{function
  graph}.



\subsection{Using Expression Trees}

The most common and well known technique that uses \glspl{expression tree} was
introduced by \textcite{AhoEtAl:1989}.
%
The approach assumes the \glspl{instruction} to be expressed in a particular
form, which will therefore be discussed first.



\paragraph{Machine Grammars}

The \gls{instruction set} of a \gls{target machine} is typically described in a
machine-readable \gls{machine description}, which can take many forms.
%
A common form is to describe the \glspl{instruction} as a \gls!{machine grammar}
(or simply called \gls!{grammar}).
%
\Glspl{machine grammar} are based on \glspl{context-free
  grammar}~\cite{AhoEtAl:2006}, which are used for describing language syntax.
%
A \gls{grammar} consists of \glspl!{terminal}, \glspl!{nonterminal}, and
\glspl!{rule}.
%
In this context, a \gls{terminal} is a symbol representing an \gls{operation}
(e.g.\ \opAdd, \opLT, \opLoad), and a \gls{nonterminal} is a symbol representing
an abstract result (e.g.\ $\mNT{Reg}$) produced by the \gls{instruction}.
%
To distinguish between the two, \glspl{terminal} are written entirely in lower
case whereas \glspl{nonterminal} start with a capital letter and are set in
italics.
%
A \gls{rule} describes the behavior of an \gls{instruction} and consists of a
\gls!{production}, a non-negative cost, and an action.
%
\Glspl{production} describe how derive \glspl{nonterminal}, and are written as
%
\begin{displaymath}
  a \rightarrow b c \ldots
\end{displaymath}
%
where the left-hand side is consists a \gls{nonterminal} and the right-hand side
consists of a sequence of \glspl{terminal} and \glspl{nonterminal}.
%
Each \gls{instruction} therefore gives rise to one or more \glspl{production},
where the right-hand side of a \gls{production} captures a \gls{pattern} of the
\gls{instruction} and the left-hand side denotes the result produced by the
\gls{instruction}.
%
Hence the left-hand and right-hand sides of a \gls{rule} are referred to as the
\gls{rule}'s \glsshort!{rule result} and \glsshort!{rule pattern}, respectively.
%
The structure is also illustrated in \refFigure{machine-grammar-rule-anatomy},
and an example of a few \glspl{rule} is given in
\refTable{grammar-rules-example}.

%
The \glspl{production} are typically written in Polish notation to avoid the
need for parentheses (for example, \mbox{$1 + (2 + 3)$} is written as \mbox{$+
  \; 1 + 2 \; 3$}).
%
Similarly, the \gls{expression tree} shown in
\refFigure{p-match-sel-example-tree} can be expressed as \mbox{$\opLoad \;
  \opAdd \; \opMul \; \opAdd \; \opVar{i} \; \opVar{1} \; \opVar{4} \;
  \opVar{A}$}.

  \labelTable{grammar-rules-example}
\end{table}

Consequently, with a \gls{grammar} the \gls{pattern selection} problem
becomes equivalent to finding a sequence of \gls{rule} applications (called
\glspl!{rule reduction}) that reduces the \gls{expression tree} to a given
\gls{nonterminal}.
%
A method for finding the sequence with least cost is described shortly.



\paragraph{Machine Grammars in Normal Form}

To simplify \gls{pattern matching} and \gls{pattern selection}, a \gls{grammar}
can be rewritten into \gls!{normal form.g}. A \gls{grammar} is in \gls{normal
  form.g} if every \gls{rule} in the \gls{grammar} has a \gls{production} in one
of the following forms:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \mbox{$\mNT{N} \rightarrow \irCode{op} \; \mNT{A}[1] \; \mNT{A}[2]
    \ldots \mNT{A}[n]$}, where \irCode{op} is a \gls{terminal}, representing an
    \gls{operation} that takes $n$ arguments, and all $\mNT{A}[i]$ are
    \glspl{nonterminal}.
    %
    Such rules are called \gls!{base.r}[ \glspl{rule}].
  \item \mbox{$\mNT{N} \rightarrow \irCode{t}$}, where \irCode{t} is a
    \gls{terminal}.
    %
    Such rules are also called \gls{base.r} \glspl{rule}.
  \item \mbox{$\mNT{N} \rightarrow \mNT{A}$}, where $\mNT{A}$ is a
    \gls{nonterminal}.
    %
    Such rules are called \gls!{chain.r}[ \glspl{rule}].

          }
  \labelTable{normal-form-grammar-example}
\end{table}

A \gls{grammar} can be mechanically rewritten into \gls{normal form.g} by
introducing new \glspl{nonterminal} and breaking down illegal \glspl{rule} into
multiple, smaller \glspl{rule} until the \gls{grammar} is in \gls{normal
  form.g}.
%
For example, rewriting the \gls{grammar} shown in
\refTable{grammar-rules-example} into \gls{normal form.g} results in the
\gls{grammar} shown in \refTable{normal-form-grammar-example}.
%
Note that the new \glspl{rule} have zero cost and no action as these are only
intermediary steps towards enabling reduction of the original \gls{rule}.

Since all \glspl{production} in a \glsshort{normal form.g} \gls{grammar} have at
most one \gls{terminal}, the \gls{pattern matching} problem becomes trivial
(simply match the \gls{node} type against the \gls{terminal} in all \gls{base.r}
\glspl{rule}).
%
Otherwise another bottom-up traversal of the \gls{expression tree} would have to
be made in order to find all \glspl{match}, which can be done in linear time for
most reasonable \glspl{grammar}~\cite{HoffmannODonnell:1982}.
%
As we will see, this also simplifies \gls{pattern selection} as the
\glspl{pattern} on the right-hand side in all \glspl{production} have uniform
height.



\paragraph{Optimal Pattern Selection on Expression Trees}

The technique by \citeauthor{AhoEtAl:1989} is centered around the following
assumption: the cost of reducing \gls{node}~$n$ in an \gls{expression tree} to
\gls{nonterminal}~$s$ using \gls{rule}~$r$ is the cost of $r$ plus the costs of
reducing all children of $n$ to the appropriate \glspl{nonterminal} appearing on
the right-hand side of~$r$.
%
If $r$ is a \gls{chain.r} \gls{rule} then the cost is computed as the cost of
$r$ plus the cost of reducing $n$ to the \glsshort{rule result} of~$r$.
%
The recursive nature of these costs can be exploited using dynamic programming,
resulting in the algorithm shown in \refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm} which
computes the least cost of reducing a given \gls{expression tree} to a
particular \gls{nonterminal}.

\end{algorithm}

The algorithm works as follows.
%
It first constructs a cost matrix~$C$, where rows represent \glspl{node} in the
\gls{expression tree} and columns represent \glspl{nonterminal} in the
\gls{grammar}, which is assumed to be in \gls{normal form.g}.%
%
\!\footnote{The algorithm can be adapted to accept any \gls{grammar} by
  expanding the \algStyle{FindMatchingRules} and \algStyle{ComputeReductionCost}
  functions to handle \glspl{rule} of arbitrary form.}
%
The cost in each element~\mbox{$C[i][j]$} is initialized to infinity, indicating
that there exists no sequence of \glspl{rule reduction} which reduces
\gls{node}~$i$ to \gls{nonterminal}~$j$.
%
It then computes the costs by traversing the \gls{expression tree} bottom up.
%
At each \gls{node}~$n$ and for each matching \gls{base.r} \gls{rule}~$r$, with
\gls{nonterminal}~$s$ as \glsshort{rule result}, it computes the cost~$c$ of
applying $r$ at~$n$ to produce~$s$ according to the scheme stated above.
%
If $c$ is less than the currently recorded cost for reducing $n$ to $s$, then
the cost and \gls{rule} information for $n$ is updated accordingly.
%
The same is then done for all \gls{chain.r} \glspl{rule} until it reaches a
fixpoint (which must eventually be reached as all \gls{rule} costs are
non-negative and an update only occurs when the cost is strictly less).
%
Since every \gls{node} is also only processed once, the algorithm runs in linear
time with respect to the size of the \gls{expression tree}.
%
Having computed the costs, the optimal order of \glspl{rule reduction} -- which
is equivalent to the \gls{least-cost.c} \gls{cover} -- can be found using the
algorithm shown in \refAlgorithm{aho-etal-select-algorithm}.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
  \DeclFunction{Select}{expression tree $T$,
                        goal nonterminal $g$,

  {%
    $n$ \Assign root node of $T$\;
    $r$ \Assign $C[n][g]$.rule\;
    \eIf{$r$ is a chain rule}{%
      $s$ \Assign result of $r$\;
      \Call{Select}{$T$, $s$, $C$}\;
    }{%
      \For{$i \leftarrow 1$ \KwTo $|n|$}{%
        $m$ \Assign $i$th child of $n$\;
        $s$ \Assign $i$th nonterminal in pattern of $r$\;
        \Call{Select}{expression tree rooted at $m$, $s$}\;
      }
    }
    execute actions associated with $r$\;
  }

\end{algorithm}

In many cases, this technique produces code of sufficient quality.
%
In fact, for architectures with simple \glspl{instruction set}, where the
\glspl{rule pattern} can naturally be modeled as trees, it is often optimal or
near optimal.
%
The MIPS \gls{instruction set}~\cite{Sweetman:2006}, for example, is one such
architecture.



\paragraph{Precomputing Costs and Rule Decisions}

Shortly after its introduction, it was recognized that the costs computed by
\refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm} could be precomputed for any
\glspl{expression tree}, thereby replacing the call to the
\algStyle{ComputeReductionCost} function with a table lookup.
%
While this improvement does not affect the asymptotic complexity, it does
significantly reduce the runtime of the algorithm.
%
Although pioneered by \textcite{HatcherChristopher:1986}, the idea was first
successfully applied by \textcite{Pelegri-LlopartGraham:1988}, and later
improved and simplified by \textcite{BalachandranEtAl:1990} and
\textcite{Proebsting:1992:PLDI}.
%
The \gls{expression tree} is traversed bottom up and labeled with a
\gls!{state}.
%
For a given labeled \gls{node}~$n$, the \gls{state} essentially holds enough
information needed to optimally reduce the \gls{expression tree} rooted at~$n$
to any \gls{nonterminal}.
%
At first glance, it would seem that this requires an infinite number of
\glspl{state} since \glspl{expression tree} can be of arbitrary size, but this
only applies if the full cost of the entire \gls{expression tree} is taken into
account.
%
Fortunately, it is sufficient to only consider the relative cost differences
between \glspl{rule} for any given \gls{node} in the \gls{expression tree},
leading to a finite number of \glspl{state}.

The idea for computing the \glspl{state} -- which will only be described briefly
-- works as follows.
%
First the states for all leaf \glspl{node} are built, considering only
\gls{base.r} \glspl{rule} with a single \glspl{terminal} on the right-hand side
in the \gls{production}.
%
The costs and \gls{rule} decisions are computed using the same logic as in
\refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm}, lines~8--21.
%
The leaf \gls{state} are then pushed onto a queue.
%
Each popped \gls{state} is used as the $i$th child to all \gls{base.r}
\glspl{rule} with a non-leaf \glspl{terminal} in combination with all other
existing \glspl{state}.
%
If any combination gives rise to a new set of costs and \gls{rule} decisions,
then a new \gls{state} is created and pushed onto the queue.
%
This process continues until the queue is empty, whereupon all necessary
\glspl{state} have been built.

The main disadvantage of operating on \glspl{expression tree} is that common
subexpressions have to be either split along the \glspl{edge} or duplicated when
building the \gls{IR}.
%
Depending on the \gls{instruction set}, these decisions can prevent selection of
\glspl{instruction} that would lead to higher code quality.
%
An example illustrating this effect is shown in
\refFigure{exp-trees-limit-example}.
%
If the \gls{IR} is represented as trees, where the common subexpression for
computing \irVar{t} has its own \gls{expression tree} (see
\refFigure{exp-trees-limit-example-trees}), then matches~$m_1$,~$m_2$, and~$m_3$
must be selected, which results in a total cost of \mbox{$2 + 3 + 5 = 10$}.
%
If represented as a \gls{block DAG} (see
\refFigure{exp-trees-limit-example-dag}), it becomes possible of selecting
matches matches~$m_4$ and~$m_5$, resulting in a total cost is \mbox{$4 + 5 =
  9$}.
%
Duplicating the \glspl{node} of the common subexpression would, in this case,
yield the same \glspl{cover}, but would have resulted in suboptimal code in
cases where the \instrCode{addmul} and \instrCode{addload} \glspl{instruction}
are not available.




\subsection{Using Block DAGs}

The cost of improving code quality by moving from \glspl{expression tree} to
\glspl{block DAG} is that \gls{optimal.ps} \gls{pattern selection} becomes an
NP-complete problem~\cite{KoesGoldstein:2008,Proebsting:1995:Proof} (the proof
is available in \refSection{optimal-p-sel-np-completeness-proof}).
%
Consequently, traditional approaches sacrifice optimality in favor of retaining
linear-time complexity.



\paragraph{Maximum Munch}

The most common approach for greedy \gls{pattern selection} on \glspl{block DAG}
is called \gls!{maximum munch} (coined by \textcite{Cattell:1978}).
%
The idea is to traverse the \gls{block DAG} top down, select the largest
\gls{pattern} that matches the current \gls{node}, and repeat the process for
remaining, uncovered parts of the \gls{block DAG}.
%
The approach -- which is used in, for example, LLVM~\cite{LattnerAdve:2004} --
works well for architectures with a regular \gls{instruction set} and where
there is a strong correlation between the effectiveness of the \gls{instruction}
and the size of its \gls{pattern}.
%
In addition to being non-optimal, however, it also suffers from the same
drawback as \glspl{expression tree} regarding whether to select \glspl{cover}
that effectively split or duplicate the common subexpressions.



\paragraph{Balancing Splitting and Duplication}

Several approaches have been made in attempting to balance splitting and
duplication.
%
\textcite{FauthEtAl:1994} designed an heuristic algorithm that rewrites the
\gls{block DAG} into \glspl{expression tree} before \gls{instruction
  selection}.
%
Using a rough estimate of cost, the algorithm favors \gls{node} duplication and
resorts to \gls{edge} splitting when the former becomes too costly.
%
Once rewritten, the \glspl{expression tree} are covered using an improved
variant of \refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm}.

\textcite{Ertl:1999} showed that, for certain \glspl{grammar},
\refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm} can be adapted to produce optimal
\glspl{cover} for \glspl{block DAG}.
%
The idea is to first compute the costs for
each \gls{node} as if the \gls{block DAG} had been rewritten into a
\gls{expression tree} using duplication.
%
Then, if several \glspl{rule} reduce the same \gls{node} to the same
\gls{nonterminal}~$n$, then $n$ can be shared between the \glspl{rule} whose
\glsplshort{rule pattern} contain $n$.
%
\citeauthor{Ertl:1999} also introduced an algorithm for checking whether
\gls{optimal.ps} \gls{pattern selection} is guaranteed for a given
\gls{grammar}.

\textcite{KoesGoldstein:2008} combined the ideas by \citeauthor{FauthEtAl:1994}
and \citeauthor{Ertl:1999} by introducing a design that first uses
\refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm} to compute the costs for a duplicated
\gls{expression tree}.
%
Then, at each \glspl{node}~$n$ where several \glspl{pattern} in the optimal
\gls{cover} overlap in the \gls{block DAG}, two costs are estimated: the cost
incurred by allowing overlap, and the cost incurred by splitting the edges.
%
If the latter cost is less then $n$ is marked as \gls!{fixed.n}, meaning it can
only be covered by \glspl{pattern} where $n$ is the root \gls{node}.
%
Once all such nodes have been processed, another pass is performed to recompute
the costs, this time forbidding overlap at \gls{fixed.n} \glspl{node}.



\paragraph{Limitations}

The main limitation of these approaches is that they are restricted to
tree-shaped \glspl{pattern}, meaning they only support \glspl{instruction} that
produce a single value.
%
Many \glspl{instruction set}, however, contain \glspl{instruction} that produce
multiple values, such as memory \glspl{instruction} that load a value from
memory while simultaneously incrementing the address.
%
Modeling such \glspl{instruction} require \gls{DAG}-shaped \glspl{pattern}, but
this also turns the \gls{pattern matching} problem into an NP-complete
problem~\cite{Cook:1971}.

Moreover, in some cases the decisions made for one \gls{block} can inhibit
subsequent decisions for other \glspl{block}.

For example, ...
