\chapter{Existing Instruction Selection Techniques and Representations}
\labelChapter{existing-isel-techniques-and-reps}

This chapter introduces terminology and relevant background.
%
\refSection{refining-instruction-selection-into-a-graph-problem} refines
\gls{instruction selection} into a graph problem and provides many definitions
that will be used throughout the dissertation.
%
\refSection{traditional-approaches} discusses existing \glspl{traditional
  approach} to \gls{instruction selection}, and
\refSection{combinatorial-approaches} discusses the \glsshort{combinatorial
  approach} counterparts.
%
In this dissertation, \glsshort!{traditional approach} approaches include the
techniques discussed in most \gls{compiler} textbooks, and derivations thereof.
%
\Glsshort!{combinatorial approach} approaches include techniques that solve
\gls{instruction selection} using a model that consists of \glspl{variable},
constraints, and an objective function.
%
The model is then solved using either complete methods or greedy heuristics.

A more extensive discussion is also given in
\refAppendixRange{macro-expansion}{graph-covering}, which includes the material
discussed in this chapter.



\section{Refining Instruction Selection into a Graph Problem}
\labelSection{refining-instruction-selection-into-a-graph-problem}

\Gls{instruction selection} can be reduced into two subproblems:%
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finding all instances of instructions that can implement one or more
    \glspl{operation} in the \gls{program}.
  \item Selecting a subset of these instances such that all \glspl{operation}
    are implemented.
\end{enumerate}
%
Without loss of generality, assume that the input to the \gls{instruction
  selector} to consist of a single \gls{function}, which in turn consists of
many \glspl{basic block} (henceforth referred to as simply \glspl!{block}).

Most \glspl{compiler} solve the two problems above using \gls{graph}-based
methods.
%
First, the \gls{IR} code is transformed into a \gls!{data-flow graph}, where
\glspl{node} represent \glspl{operation} in the function and \glspl{edge}
represent data dependencies between the \glspl{operation}.
%
\Glspl{data-flow graph} are called \glspl!{expression tree} if they are limited
to single, tree-shaped expressions, \glspl!{block DAG} if they capture many
expressions in a \gls{block} as a \gls{DAG}, and \glspl{data-flow graph} if they
capture the data flow of entire functions.
%
An \gls{instruction selector} is \gls!{local.is} if it selects
\glspl{instruction} for \glspl{expression tree} or \glspl{block DAG}, and
\gls!{global.is} if it does so for \glspl{function graph}.
%
Corresponding \glspl{data-flow graph}, called \glspl!{pattern graph} (or simply
\glspl!{pattern}), are also built to represent the \gls{instruction} provided by
the \gls{target machine}.
%
The set of \glspl{pattern graph} for a particular \gls{target machine}
constitute a \gls!{pattern set}.

The first subproblem can be reduced to finding all instances where a
\gls{pattern} from the \gls{pattern set} is \gls{subgraph} isomorphic to~$G$,
where $G$ denotes either a \gls{block DAG} or a \gls{function graph}.
%
Each such instance is called a \gls!{match}, and the set of all \glspl{match}
constitute a \gls!{match set}, which is denoted by~$M$.
%
Hence this subproblem is referred to as the \gls!{pattern matching}[ problem].
%
\Gls{pattern matching} can be done in linear time if both $G$ and all
\glspl{pattern} are tree-shaped, otherwise it is an NP-complete
problem~\cite{GareyJohnson:1979,HoffmannODonnell:1982}.
%
Having found $M$, the second subproblem -- which is referred to as the
\gls!{pattern selection}[ problem] -- can be reduced to selecting a set of
\glspl{match} that \gls{cover}[s]~$G$.
%
A subset~\mbox{$C \subseteq M$}, where $M$ is a \gls{match set},
\gls!{cover}[s] $G$ if every \gls{operation} in $G$ appears in exactly one match
from~$C$.
%
Such a subset is called a \gls!{cover}, and an example is shown in
\refFigure{p-match-sel-example}.

            is stored in memory and that an integer is 4~bytes).
            %
            Valid covers are \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_2, m_3, m_5}$},
            \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_4, m_5}$}, and \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_6}$}.
            %
            Note that variable assignments are not explicitly represented as
            nodes as this information can be propagated from the root node of
            an expression tree after having found a cover%
          }
  \labelFigure{p-match-sel-example}
\end{figure}

For a given \gls{program} and \gls{target machine}, there often exists many
valid combinations of \glspl{instruction} -- in terms of $G$ and $M$, this means
there exist many \glspl{cover} of~$G$ -- which may result in code where quality
differs significantly.
%
In certain cases, the performance of two sets of selected instructions may
differ by as much as two orders of magnitude~\cite{ZivojnovicEtAl:1994}.
%
Consequently, the \gls{pattern selection} problem -- originally defined to
accept any valid \gls{cover} -- is augmented into an optimization problem called
\gls!{optimal.ps} \gls{pattern selection}, where only \glspl{cover} with least
cost are accepted.
%
The cost of a \gls{cover}~$C$ is the sum of the costs for the \glspl{match}
appearing in~$C$, where the cost of a \gls{match} has been assigned to reflect a
desired characteristic in the produced code.
%
For example, assume that the \instrCode{add}, \instrCode{mul}, and
\instrCode{muladd} \glspl{instruction} in \refFigure{p-match-sel-example} take
one cycle to execute whereas the \instrCode{load} and \instrCode{amload}
\glspl{instruction} take five cycles to execute.
%
Assume further that the \gls{compiler} should maximize performance.
%
The corresponding matches \mbox{$m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, m_6$} are therefore
assigned costs \mbox{$1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5$}, respectively.
%
Then, of the valid \glspl{cover} \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_2, m_3, m_5}$},
\mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_4, m_5}$}, and \mbox{$\mSet{m_1, m_6}$}, only the last
\gls{cover} is considered \gls{optimal.ps} as it has a total cost of~6 whereas
the other two \glspl{cover} have costs~8 and~7, respectively.
%
There is typically a strong correlation between the size of a \gls{cover} and
its cost -- smaller \glspl{cover} lead to less cost, and ultimately better code
-- but this depends heavily on the properties of the \gls{target machine}.



\section{Traditional Approaches}
\labelSection{traditional-approaches}

In the interest of producing decent code while maintaining short compilation
times, most modern \glspl{compiler} either limit themselves to \glspl{expression
  tree} or apply greedy, linear-time heuristics.
%
For \glspl{expression tree} one can find \gls{least-cost.c} \glspl{cover} in
linear time, but at the price of precluding optimization decisions that only
become possible when operating on \glsshort{block DAG} or \glspl{function
  graph}.



\subsection{Approaches Using Expression Trees}

The most common and well known technique that uses \glspl{expression tree} was
introduced by \textcite{AhoEtAl:1989}.
%
The approach assumes the \glspl{instruction} to be expressed in a particular
form, which will therefore be discussed first.



\paragraph{Machine Grammars}

The \gls{instruction set} of a \gls{target machine} is typically described in a
machine-readable \gls{machine description}, which can take many forms.
%
A common form is to describe the \glspl{instruction} as a \gls!{machine grammar}
(or simply called \gls!{grammar}).
%
\Glspl{machine grammar} are based on \glspl{context-free
  grammar}~\cite{AhoEtAl:2006}, which are used for describing language syntax.
%
A \gls{grammar} consists of \glspl{terminal}, \glspl{nonterminal}, and
\glspl{rule}.
%
In this context, a \gls!{terminal} is a symbol representing an \gls{operation}
(e.g.\ \opAdd, \opLT, \opLoad), and a \gls!{nonterminal} is a symbol
representing an abstract result (e.g.\ $\mNT{Reg}$) produced by the
\gls{instruction}.
%
To distinguish between the two, \glspl{terminal} are written entirely in lower
case whereas \glspl{nonterminal} start with a capital letter and are set in
italics.
%
A \gls!{rule} describes the behavior of an \gls{instruction} and consists of a
\gls{production}, a non-negative cost, and an action.
%
\Glspl!{production} describe how to derive \glspl{nonterminal}, and are written
as
%
\begin{displaymath}
  a \rightarrow b c \ldots
\end{displaymath}
%
where the left-hand side is consists a \gls{nonterminal} and the right-hand side
consists of a sequence of \glspl{terminal} and \glspl{nonterminal}.
%
Each \gls{instruction} therefore gives rise to one or more \glspl{production},
where the right-hand side of a \gls{production} captures a \gls{pattern} of the
\gls{instruction} and the left-hand side denotes the result produced by the
\gls{instruction}.
%
Hence the left-hand and right-hand sides of a \gls{rule} are referred to as the
\gls{rule}'s \glsshort!{rule result} and \glsshort!{rule pattern}, respectively.
%
The \gls{rule} structure is also illustrated in
\refFigure{machine-grammar-rule-anatomy}, and an example of a few \glspl{rule}
is given in \refTable{grammar-rules-example}.

%
The \glspl{production} are typically written in Polish notation to avoid the
need for parentheses (for example, \mbox{$1 + (2 + 3)$} is written as \mbox{$+
  \; 1 + 2 \; 3$}).
%
Similarly, the \gls{expression tree} shown in
\refFigure{p-match-sel-example-tree} can be expressed as \mbox{$\opLoad \;
  \opAdd \; \opMul \; \opAdd \; \opVar{i} \; \opVar{1} \; \opVar{4} \;
  \opVar{A}$}.

            offset by an immediate value~\instrCode{o}, and stores the loaded

          }
  \labelTable{grammar-rules-example}
\end{table}

Consequently, with a \gls{grammar} the \gls{pattern selection} problem
becomes equivalent to finding a sequence of \gls{rule} applications (called
\glspl!{rule reduction}) that reduces the \gls{expression tree} to a given
\gls{nonterminal}.
%
A method for finding the sequence with least cost is described shortly.



\paragraph{Machine Grammars in Normal Form}

To simplify \gls{pattern matching} and \gls{pattern selection}, a \gls{grammar}
can be rewritten into \gls!{normal form.g}. A \gls{grammar} is in \gls{normal
  form.g} if every \gls{rule} in the \gls{grammar} has a \gls{production} in one
of the following forms:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \mbox{$\mNT{N} \rightarrow \irCode{op} \; \mNT{A}[1] \; \mNT{A}[2]
    \ldots \mNT{A}[n]$}, where \irCode{op} is a \gls{terminal}, representing an
    \gls{operation} that takes $n$ arguments, and all $\mNT{A}[i]$ are
    \glspl{nonterminal}.
    %
    Such rules are called \gls!{base.r}[ \glspl{rule}].
  \item \mbox{$\mNT{N} \rightarrow \irCode{t}$}, where \irCode{t} is a
    \gls{terminal}.
    %
    Such rules are also called \gls{base.r} \glspl{rule}.
  \item \mbox{$\mNT{N} \rightarrow \mNT{A}$}, where $\mNT{A}$ is a
    \gls{nonterminal}.
    %
    Such rules are called \gls!{chain.r}[ \glspl{rule}].

            into base rules%
          }
  \labelTable{normal-form-grammar-example}
\end{table}

A \gls{grammar} can be mechanically rewritten into \gls{normal form.g} by
introducing new \glspl{nonterminal} and breaking down illegal \glspl{rule} into
multiple, smaller \glspl{rule} until the \gls{grammar} is in \gls{normal
  form.g}.
%
For example, rewriting the \gls{grammar} shown in
\refTable{grammar-rules-example} into \gls{normal form.g} results in the
\gls{grammar} shown in \refTable{normal-form-grammar-example}.
%
Note that the new \glspl{rule} have zero cost and no action as these are only
intermediary steps towards enabling reduction of the original \gls{rule}.

Since all \glspl{production} in a \glsshort{normal form.g} \gls{grammar} have at
most one \gls{terminal}, the \gls{pattern matching} problem becomes trivial
(simply match the \gls{node} type against the \gls{terminal} in all \gls{base.r}
\glspl{rule}).
%
Otherwise another bottom-up traversal of the \gls{expression tree} would have to
be made in order to find all \glspl{match}, which can be done in linear time for
most reasonable \glspl{grammar}~\cite{HoffmannODonnell:1982}.
%
As we will see, this also simplifies \gls{pattern selection} as the
\glspl{pattern} on the right-hand side in all \glspl{production} have uniform
height.



\paragraph{Optimal Pattern Selection on Expression Trees}

The technique by \citeauthor{AhoEtAl:1989} is centered around the following
assumption: the cost of reducing \gls{node}~$n$ in an \gls{expression tree} to
\gls{nonterminal}~$s$ using \gls{rule}~$r$ is the cost of $r$ plus the costs of
reducing all children of $n$ to the appropriate \glspl{nonterminal} appearing on
the right-hand side of~$r$.
%
If $r$ is a \gls{chain.r} \gls{rule} then the cost is computed as the cost of
$r$ plus the cost of reducing $n$ to the \glsshort{rule result} of~$r$.
%
The recursive nature of these costs can be exploited using dynamic programming,
resulting in the algorithm shown in \refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm} which
computes the least cost of reducing a given \gls{expression tree} to a
particular \gls{nonterminal}.

\!\footnote{The algorithm can be adapted to accept any \gls{grammar} by
  expanding the \algStyle{FindMatchingRules} and \algStyle{ComputeReductionCost}
  functions to handle \glspl{rule} of arbitrary form.}
%
The cost in each element~\mbox{$C[i][j]$} is initialized to infinity, indicating
that there exists no sequence of \glspl{rule reduction} which reduces
\gls{node}~$i$ to \gls{nonterminal}~$j$.
%
It then computes the costs by traversing the \gls{expression tree} bottom up.
%
At each \gls{node}~$n$ and for each matching \gls{base.r} \gls{rule}~$r$, with
\gls{nonterminal}~$s$ as \glsshort{rule result}, it computes the cost~$c$ of
applying $r$ at~$n$ to produce~$s$ according to the scheme stated above.
%
If $c$ is less than the currently recorded cost for reducing $n$ to $s$, then
the cost and \gls{rule} information for $n$ is updated accordingly.
%
The same is then done for all \gls{chain.r} \glspl{rule} until it reaches a
fixpoint (which must eventually be reached as all \gls{rule} costs are
non-negative and an update only occurs when the cost is strictly less).
%
Since every \gls{node} is also only processed once, the algorithm runs in linear
time with respect to the size of the \gls{expression tree}.
%
Having computed the costs, the optimal order of \glspl{rule reduction} -- which
is equivalent to the \gls{least-cost.c} \gls{cover} -- can be found using the
algorithm shown in \refAlgorithm{aho-etal-select-algorithm}.

In many cases, this technique produces code of sufficient quality.
%
In fact, for architectures with simple \glspl{instruction set}, where the
\glspl{rule pattern} can naturally be modeled as trees, it is often optimal or
near optimal.
%
The MIPS \gls{instruction set}~\cite{Sweetman:2006}, for example, is one such
architecture.



\paragraph{Precomputing Costs and Rule Decisions}

Shortly after its introduction, it was recognized that the costs computed by
\refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm} could be precomputed for any
\glspl{expression tree}, thereby replacing the call to the
\algStyle{ComputeReductionCost} function with a table lookup.
%
While this improvement does not affect the asymptotic complexity, it does
significantly reduce the runtime of the algorithm.
%
Although pioneered by \textcite{HatcherChristopher:1986}, the idea was first
successfully applied by \textcite{Pelegri-LlopartGraham:1988}, and later
improved and simplified by \textcite{BalachandranEtAl:1990} and
\textcite{Proebsting:1992:PLDI}.
%
The \gls{expression tree} is traversed bottom up and labeled with a
\gls!{state}.
%
For a given labeled \gls{node}~$n$, the \gls{state} essentially holds enough
information needed to optimally reduce the \gls{expression tree} rooted at~$n$
to any \gls{nonterminal}.
%
At first glance, it would seem that this requires an infinite number of
\glspl{state} since \glspl{expression tree} can be of arbitrary size, but this
only applies if the full cost of the entire \gls{expression tree} is taken into
account.
%
Fortunately, it is sufficient to only consider the relative cost differences
between \glspl{rule} for any given \gls{node} in the \gls{expression tree},
leading to a finite number of \glspl{state}.

The idea for computing the \glspl{state} -- which will only be described briefly
-- works as follows.
%
For each \gls{terminal} representing a $k$-argument \gls{operation}, an
\mbox{$k$-dimensional} matrix is maintained.
%
This is called the \gls{terminal}'s \gls!{state table}, which indicates the
state to assign such \glspl{node} given the labels of its children.
%
First the states for all leaf \glspl{node} are built, considering only
\gls{base.r} \glspl{rule} with a single \glspl{terminal} on the right-hand side
in the \gls{production}.
%
The costs and \gls{rule} decisions are computed using the same logic as in
\refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm}, lines~8--21.
%
The leaf \gls{state} are then pushed onto a queue.
%
Each popped \gls{state} is used as the $i$th child to all \gls{base.r}
\glspl{rule} with a non-leaf \glspl{terminal} in combination with all other
existing \glspl{state}.
%
If any combination gives rise to a new set of costs and \gls{rule} decisions,
then a new \gls{state} is created and pushed onto the queue after having updated
the \glspl{state table}.
%
This process continues until the queue is empty, whereupon all necessary
\glspl{state} have been built.

\begin{algorithm}[t]

               {expression tree $T$, list $L$ of state tables}%
  {%

    $k$ \Assign number of children for $n$\;
    \For{$i \leftarrow 1$ \KwTo $k$}{%

      \Call{Label}{expression tree rooted at $m_i$, $L$}\;
    }
    $S$ \Assign $L[\text{terminal corresponding to $n$}]$\;
    $n$.label \Assign $S[m_1.\text{label}, \ldots, m_k.\text{label}]$\;

The main disadvantage of operating on \glspl{expression tree} is that common
subexpressions have to be either split along the \glspl{edge} or duplicated when
building the \gls{IR}.
%
Depending on the \gls{instruction set}, these decisions can prevent selection of
\glspl{instruction} that would lead to higher code quality.
%
An example illustrating this effect is shown in
\refFigure{exp-trees-limit-example}.
%
If the \gls{IR} is represented as trees, where the common subexpression for
computing \irVar{t} has its own \gls{expression tree} (see
\refFigure{exp-trees-limit-example-trees}), then matches~$m_1$,~$m_2$, and~$m_3$
must be selected, which results in a total cost of \mbox{$2 + 3 + 5 = 10$}.
%
If represented as a \gls{block DAG} (see
\refFigure{exp-trees-limit-example-dag}), it becomes possible of selecting
matches matches~$m_4$ and~$m_5$, resulting in a total cost is \mbox{$4 + 5 =
  9$}.
%
Duplicating the \glspl{node} of the common subexpression would, in this case,
yield the same \glspl{cover}, but would have resulted in suboptimal code in
cases where the \instrCode{addmul} and \instrCode{addload} \glspl{instruction}
are not available.




\subsection{Approaches Using Block DAGs}

The cost of improving code quality by moving from \glspl{expression tree} to
\glspl{block DAG} is that \gls{optimal.ps} \gls{pattern selection} becomes an
NP-complete problem~\cite{KoesGoldstein:2008,Proebsting:1995:Proof} (the proof
is also available in \refAppendix{dag-covering}).
%
Consequently, traditional approaches sacrifice optimality in favor of retaining
linear-time complexity.



\paragraph{Maximum Munch}

The most common approach for greedy \gls{pattern selection} on \glspl{block DAG}
is called \gls!{maximum munch} (coined by \textcite{Cattell:1978}).
%
The idea is to traverse the \gls{block DAG} top down, select the largest
\gls{pattern} that matches the current \gls{node}, and repeat the process for
remaining, uncovered parts of the \gls{block DAG}.
%
The approach -- which is used in, for example, LLVM~\cite{LattnerAdve:2004} --
works well for architectures with a regular \gls{instruction set} and where
there is a strong correlation between the effectiveness of the \gls{instruction}
and the size of its \gls{pattern}.
%
In addition to being non-optimal, however, it also suffers from the same
drawback as \glspl{expression tree} regarding whether to select \glspl{cover}
that effectively split or duplicate the common subexpressions.



\paragraph{Balancing Splitting and Duplication}

Several approaches have been made in attempting to balance splitting and
duplication.
%
\textcite{FauthEtAl:1994} designed an heuristic algorithm that rewrites the
\gls{block DAG} into \glspl{expression tree} before \gls{instruction
  selection}.
%
Using a rough estimate of cost, the algorithm favors \gls{node} duplication and
resorts to \gls{edge} splitting when the former becomes too costly.
%
Once rewritten, the \glspl{expression tree} are covered using an improved
variant of \refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm}.

\textcite{Ertl:1999} showed that, for certain \glspl{grammar},
\refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm} can be adapted to produce optimal
\glspl{cover} for \glspl{block DAG}.
%
The idea is to first compute the costs for
each \gls{node} as if the \gls{block DAG} had been rewritten into a
\gls{expression tree} using duplication.
%
Then, if several \glspl{rule} reduce the same \gls{node} to the same
\gls{nonterminal}~$n$, then $n$ can be shared between the \glspl{rule} whose
\glsplshort{rule pattern} contain $n$.
%
\citeauthor{Ertl:1999} also introduced an algorithm for checking whether
\gls{optimal.ps} \gls{pattern selection} is guaranteed for a given
\gls{grammar}.

\textcite{KoesGoldstein:2008} combined the ideas by \citeauthor{FauthEtAl:1994}
and \citeauthor{Ertl:1999} by introducing a design that first uses
\refAlgorithm{aho-etal-cost-algorithm} to compute the costs for a duplicated
\gls{expression tree}.
%
Then, at each \glspl{node}~$n$ where several \glspl{pattern} in the optimal
\gls{cover} overlap in the \gls{block DAG}, two costs are estimated: the cost
incurred by allowing overlap, and the cost incurred by splitting the
\glspl{edge}.
%
If the latter cost is less then $n$ is marked as \gls!{fixed.n}, meaning it can
only be covered by \glspl{pattern} where $n$ is the root \gls{node}.
%
Once all such \glspl{node} have been processed, another pass is performed to
recompute the costs, this time forbidding overlap at \gls{fixed.n} \glspl{node}.



\paragraph{Limitations}

Although using \glspl{block DAG} addresses the issue of whether to split or
duplicate common subexpressions within a \gls{block}, the problem still remains
for expressions that are spread across multiple \glspl{block}.
%
To fully address this problem, one must resort to \glspl{function graph}.

\begin{filecontents*}{block-dags-limit-example.c}
int f(int* A, int* B, int N) {
  int s = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    s = s + A[i] * B[i];
  }
  return s;
}

\end{figure}

This also applies to other situations where decisions made for one \gls{block}
can inhibit subsequent decisions for other \glspl{block}, such as enforcing
specific storage locations or value modes.
%
For example, \refFigure{block-dags-limit-example} shows a \gls{function} that
multiplies the elements of two arrays and sums the results.
%
Assume that the arrays consist of fixed-point values.
%
For efficiency, a common idiosyncracy in many \glspl{DSP} is that multiplication
of two fixed-point values return a value that is shifted one bit to the left.
%
For such \glspl{target machine}, both the value~\irCode{0} and the accumulator
\gls{variable}~\irVar{s} should be in shifted mode throughout the entire
\gls{function}, and only restored into normal mode upon return.
%
Otherwise the accumulated value would be needlessly shifted back and forth
within the loop.
%
Achieving this, however, is difficult when limited to covering only a single
\gls{block DAG} at a time.
%
Assume for example that the function had no multiplication.
%
In that case, deciding to load value~\irCode{0} in shifted mode would instead
lower code quality as the value would needlessly have to be shifted back before
returning, which takes an extra \gls{instruction}.

Lastly, these approaches are restricted to tree-shaped \glspl{pattern},
meaning they only support \glspl{instruction} that produce a single value.
%
Many \glspl{instruction set}, however, contain \glspl{instruction} that produce
multiple values, such as memory \glspl{instruction} that load a value from
memory while simultaneously incrementing the address.
%
Modeling such \glspl{instruction} require \gls{DAG}-shaped \glspl{pattern},
which violate underlying assumptions made by the aforementioned approaches.



\subsection{Approaches Using Function Graphs}

To the best of my knowledge, only \textcite{PalecznyEtAl:2001} have attempted to
apply \glsshort{traditional approach} methods on \glspl{function graph}.
%
The approach represents \glspl{function} using a graph-based \gls{IR}, which
will therefore be discussed first.

Graph-based \glspl{IR} that represent entire \glspl{function} are colloquially
referred to as \glspl!{sea-of-nodes IR}.
%
One such \gls{IR} was introduced by \textcite{ClickPaleczny:1995} which, for
lack of better name, will be referred to as the \gls!{Click-Paleczny graph} in
this dissertation.

The \gls{Click-Paleczny graph} assumes the \gls{function} to be in \gls!{SSA}
\glsEmph{form}~\cite{CytronEtAl:1991}, in which a \gls{variable} is defined
exactly once.
%
For example, the \gls{function} shown in \refFigure{sea-of-nodes-example-c}
is not in \gls{SSA}~form as \glspl{variable}~\irCode{f} and~\irCode{n} are
redefined within the loop.
%
By introducing new \glspl{variable} and connecting these using
\glspl!{phi-function} where the value depends on control flow, the
\gls{function} can be rewritten into \gls{SSA}~form, as shown in
\refFigure{sea-of-nodes-example-ssa-c}.

Like in \glspl{data-flow graph}, each \gls{operation} in the SSA-based
\gls{function} is represented as a \gls{node}.
%
These nodes are connected using data-flow \glspl{edge}, ignoring the fact that
the \glspl{operation} may belong to different \glspl{block}.
%
This forms a \gls{data-flow graph} called the \gls!{SSA
  graph}~\cite{GerlekEtAl:1995} (see
\refFigure{sea-of-nodes-example-ssa-graph}).
%
The control flow is captured using \glspl{node} to represent the \glspl{block}
in the \gls{function} and \glspl{edge} to represent jumps between \glspl{block}.
%
Conditional jumps flow through special \emph{if}~\glspl{node}, thereby allowing
dependencies between data and control flow to be captured.
%
An example is shown in \refFigure{sea-of-nodes-example-click-paleczny-graph}.

Since \glspl{operation} are not pre-assigned to specific \glspl{block}, the same
\gls{IR} can be used for performing \gls{global code motion}.
%
If an \gls{operation} should not be allowed to be moved to another \gls{block}
-- like with \glspl{phi-function} and returns -- then an \gls{edge} can be used
to connect the \gls{operation} with its original \gls{block} placement.



\paragraph{Pattern Selection on a Sea of Nodes}

\citeauthor{PalecznyEtAl:2001} first divides the \gls{function graph} into a set
of possibly overlapping \glspl{expression tree}.
%
This is done by labeling certain \glspl{node} in the \gls{function graph} as
tree roots.
%
Root candidates are \glspl{node} representing \glspl{operation} whose result are
shared or \glspl{operation} with side effects and may therefore not be
duplicated.
%
The selection of roots is geared towards duplicating address computations and
other expressions that can be subsumed into a single \gls{instruction}.

Once labeled, each \gls{expression tree} is covered using a variant of
\refAlgorithm{opt-pat-sel-labeling-algorithm}.
%
The \glspl{instruction} are then emitted and placed in \glspl{block} using a
method described in~\cite{Click:1995}.



\section{Combinatorial Approaches}
\labelSection{combinatorial-approaches}

A trait exhibited by \glspl{combinatorial approach} is that, unlike
\glspl{traditional approach}, they first create a model that describes the
\gls{instruction selection} problem and then solve the model.
%
In doing so, they may choose between applying either complete solving methods --
for optimality -- or greedy heuristics -- for tractability.

Since there already exist methods for optimally covering \glspl{expression tree}
in linear time, nearly all \glspl{combinatorial approach} operate on
\glspl{block DAG}, with one exception operating on \glspl{function graph}.
%
The approaches in this section are therefore grouped according to the tools they
apply for modeling \gls{instruction selection}.

Most approaches also natively support \gls{DAG}-shaped \glspl{pattern}, but
finding \glspl{match} for such \glspl{pattern} can no longer be done in linear
time.
%
Consequently, they typically apply generic \glshyphened{subgraph isomorphism}
algorithms when \gls{pattern matching}.



\paragraph{Pattern Matching as a Subgraph Isomorphism Problem}

\def\mGP{G_{\textsc{p}}}
\def\mGF{G_{\textsc{f}}}
\def\mNP{N_{\textsc{p}}}
\def\mNF{N_{\textsc{f}}}
\def\mEP{E_{\textsc{p}}}
\def\mEF{E_{\textsc{f}}}

The \gls!{subgraph isomorphism} problem, which is known to be
NP-complete~{\cite{Cook:1971}}, is to find instances where a
\gls{graph}~\mbox{$\mGP = \mPair*{\mNP}{\mEP}$} is \glsshort{isomorphism} to a
\gls{subgraph} in another \gls{graph}~\mbox{$\mGF = \mPair*{\mNF}{\mEF}$}.
%
$\mGP$ is \glsshort!{isomorphism} to $\mGF$ if and only if there exists a
mapping \mbox{$\mFunDecl{m}{\mNP}{\mNF}$} such that \mbox{$\mPair*{n}{o} \in
  \mEP$} implies \mbox{$\mPair*{f(n)}{f(o)} \in \mEF$}.
%
In this context, $\mGP$ denotes the \gls{pattern}, $\mGF$ denotes the \gls{block
  DAG} or \gls{function graph}, and $m$ denotes a \gls{match}.

As \gls{subgraph isomorphism} appears in many other fields, much research has
been devoted to this problem (see for example \cite{Ullmann:1976,
  CordellaEtAl:2001, GuoEtAl:2003, KrissinelHenrick:2004, SorlinSolnon:2004,
  Gallagher:2006, FanEtAl:2010, FanEtAl:2011, HinoEtAl:2012, McCreesh:2017}).
%
Due to its simplicity, most approaches apply the algorithm given in
\cite{CordellaEtAl:2001}, of which a detailed description is given in
\refChapter{pattern-matching}.



\subsection{MIS- and MWIS-based Approaches}

One approach to modeling \gls{instruction selection} is to model it as a problem
of finding \glspl{independent set}.
%
Given a \gls{graph}~\mbox{$G = \mPair{N}{E}$}, a set \mbox{$S \subseteq N$} is
an \gls!{independent set} if no pairs of nodes~\mbox{$m, n \in S$} are adjacent
in~$G$.
%
An \gls{independent set} is called a \gls!{MIS} if no more \glspl{node} can be
added and still be an \gls{independent set}.
%
If each \gls{node} in the graph has a weight, then a \gls!{MWIS} is a \gls{MIS}
that maximizes/minimizes \mbox{$\sum_n \mWeight(n)$}.
%
In general, finding a \gls{MIS} or \gls{MWIS} is
NP-complete~\cite{GareyJohnson:1979}.

Modeling \gls{instruction selection} as either a \gls{MIS} or \gls{MWIS} problem
is done as follows.
%
After \gls{pattern matching}, an \gls!{interference graph} is constructed where
a \gls{node} represents a \gls{match} and an \gls{edge} represents overlapping
between two \glspl{match}.
%
If all \glspl{operation} in the \gls{block DAG} or \gls{function graph} can be
covered by at least one \gls{match}, then a \gls{MIS} of the \gls{interference
  graph} corresponds to a \gls{cover}.
%
Likewise, a \gls{MWIS} corresponds to a \gls{least-cost.c} \gls{cover}.
%
An example is shown in \refFigure{mis-example}.

            block DAG%
          }

\end{figure}



\paragraph{Applications}

\textcite{ScharwaechterEtAl:2007} appears to have pioneered the modeling of
\gls{instruction selection} as a \gls{MWIS} problem, although the main
contribution of their paper is the extension of \glspl{machine grammar} to
handle \glspl{instruction} that produce multiple results.
%
The idea is basically to let \gls!{complex.r}[ \glspl{rule}] consist of multiple
\glspl{production}, called \gls!{split.p}[ \glspl{pattern}] -- one for each
result -- which are matched individually.
%
After \gls{pattern matching}, the \glspl{match} derived from \gls{split.p}
\glspl{pattern} are either combined -- indicating use of the \gls{complex.r}
\gls{rule} -- or kept -- indicating use of \glspl{rule} that only produce a
single result.
%
This is done according to a heuristic that estimates the cost saved by using the
\gls{complex.r} \gls{rule} versus the cost incurred by having to duplicate
\glspl{node} in common subexpressions.
%
Once these decisions have been taken, the \gls{interference graph} is built and
the \gls{MWIS} found using a greedy heuristic~\cite{SakaiEtAl:2003}.

The approach was later extended by \textcite{AhnEtAl:2009} to include scheduling
dependency conflicts between \gls{complex.p} \glspl{pattern} in order to
facilitate \gls{register allocation}.
%
Also, a shortcoming of both designs -- that \gls{complex.r} \glspl{rule} can
only consist of disconnected \glspl{pattern}, hence forbidding sharing of values
across the \gls{split.p} \glspl{pattern} -- was addressed by
\textcite{YounEtAl:2011} by introducing the use of index subscripts for the
\glspl{node} representing the input arguments.



\subsection{PBQP-based Approaches}

Another method of modeling \gls{instruction selection} is to model it as a
\gls!{PBQP}.
%
First introduced by \textcite{ScholzEckstein:2002} to model and solve
\gls{register allocation}, \gls{PBQP} is a variant of the \gls!{QAP}, which is a
fundamental combinatorial optimization problem in the operations research field
(see \cite{LoiolaEtAl:2007} for a survey).
%
Although both problems are NP-complete in general, a subclass of \gls{PBQP} can
be solved in linear time which inspired \citeauthor{ScholzEckstein:2002} in
developing a greedy, linear-time solver.

\Gls{PBQP} is formally defined as
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rll}
    \text{minimize}
      & \multicolumn{2}{c}{%
          \displaystyle\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} \mVar{x}_i C_{ij} \mVar{x}_j^T +
          \displaystyle\sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} \mVector{c}_i \mVar{x}_i^T\!,%
        } \\
    \text{such that}
      & \mVar{x}_i \in \mSet{0, 1}^{|c_i|}\!
      & \forall 1 \leq i \leq n, \\
    \text{and}
      & \mVar{x}_i \mVector{1}^T = 1
      & \forall 1 \leq i \leq n. \\
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
%
Intuitively, one can interpret this definition as follows.
%
Assume a problem consists of $n$~decisions, each with $k$~choices.
%
Then $\mVar{x}_i$ is a decision vector with $k$~elements, where
\mbox{$\mVar{x}_i[j] = 1$} means that choice~$j$ has been selected for
decision~$i$.
%
For each decision vector, the condition \mbox{$\mVar{x}_i
  \raisebox{0pt}[\height-2pt]{$\mVector{1}^T$} = 1$} ensures that exactly one
choice is selected.
%
The cost of selecting a particular choice for decision~$i$ is represented
through a cost vector~$\mVector{c}_i$, and the cost of combining two
decisions~$i$ and~$j$ are represented through a cost matrix~$C_{ij}$.%
%
\footnote{In this dissertation, vectors representing decisions are typeset in
  bold face and vectors representing fixed values, such as costs, are typeset in
  italics with an arrow on top.}

In this context, $\mVar{x}_i$ decides whether to select a particular \gls{match}
to cover \gls{node}~$i$, $\mVector{c}_i$ contains the cost for each such
\gls{match}, and $C_{ij}$ contains the cost of additional \glspl{instruction}
that may need to be selected due to certain combinations of \glspl{match}.
%
For example, assume two nodes~$i$ and~$j$ where $j$ depends on $i$.
%
Assume further that the \glspl{instruction} are represented as a \gls{machine
  grammar}, and that~$i$ and~$j$ can be covered using two \glspl{rule}, $r_i$
and $r_j$, with \glspl{production} \mbox{$\mNT{A} \rightarrow
  \irCode{op}_{\mathit{i}} \; \mNT{A} \; \mNT{A}$} and \mbox{$\mNT{B}
  \rightarrow \irCode{op}_{\mathit{j}} \; \mNT{B} \; \mNT{B}$}, respectively.
%
Since the result of $r_i$ does not match the operands of $r_j$, this \gls{rule}
combination requires a \gls{chain.r} \gls{rule} -- or a chain of these, if
necessary -- that derives $\mNT{B}$ from $\mNT{A}$.
%
Illegal combinations are prevented by assigning infinite cost.
%
An example of a \gls{PBQP} instance is shown in \refFigure{pbqp-example}.

\paragraph{Handling DAG-shaped Patterns}

The \gls{PBQP} model above assumes that all \glspl{pattern} are shaped as trees.
%
To handle \gls{DAG}-shaped \glspl{pattern}, the model must be extended.
%
First assume a \gls{grammar} that allows multi-output \glspl{instruction} to be
described as \gls{complex.r} \glspl{rule}, where each result is described with a
\gls{production}.
