\section{Contributions}

This dissertation makes six contributions to the areas of code generation and
constraint programming:

\begin{contributions}
  \item a comprehensive and structured survey that covers over four decades of
    research in instruction selection;
  \item program and instruction representations that enable
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
      \item uniform treatment of data- and control-flow operations, and
      \item global instruction selection and global code motion to be combined
        and modeled as a constraint model;
    \end{enumerate}
  \item transformations on the representations that perform
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
      \item copy extension (to perform and account for the cost of data
        copying), and
      \item alternative value extension (to enable value reuse);
    \end{enumerate}
  \item a constraint model that -- for the first time -- integrates global
    instruction selection with global code motion, as well as data copying,
    value reuse, and block ordering;
  \item solving techniques that enables practical solving of the constraint
    model; and
  \item thorough experiments demonstrating that the approach scales to
    medium-sized programs and yields better code than traditional approaches.
\end{contributions}
